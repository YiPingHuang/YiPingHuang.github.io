        <h1>Quantum magnetism with large spin-orbit coupling</h1>
        </div>

        <p> 3d transition metal oxides provide various exotic phenomena of correlated electrons, i.e. Metal-insulator transition, superconductivity, etc. The competing effect between localized and itinerant physics made it an active research area in last fifty years. On the other hand, the discovery of topological insulator ignites the investigation of the new physics brings up by spin-orbit coupling. The interplay between correlation and spin-orbit coupling can provide the possibility to realize new phase of matter.
        </p>
        <p>
        Topological order plays a unique role in the search of new phases of matter. Topological order is a quantum phase with long ranged entangled wave function which manifests the quantum nature of the phase. That is, it is impossible to construct such state from product states without gap closing.
        </p>
        <p>Long-ranged entangled states are challenging to be realized in materials because: first, how long-ranged entangled wave functions emerge from a realistic microscopic model which is local? Second, if we obtain a particular long-ranged entangled wave function, how to have a positive diagnosis scheme to confirm the underlying quantum state is a long-ranged entangled state experimentally or numerically? It is thus necessary to find the sweet spot where experiments, theories, and numerical simulation meets to address such issue. Recent activities on the relation between symmetry and topological structure of the wave function provide a modern understanding of the long ranged entangled states. How to connect the new theoretical developments with realistic models to find better smoking gun evidence for the long ranged entangled states is an interesting and important question.

        <h2>Ions with large spin-orbit coupling on pyrochlore lattice</h2>
        </div>
        <p> We study a family of materials of 5d or 4f ions on pyrochlore lattice. Considering both spin-orbit coupling and crystal field splitting, a type of Kramers doublets transform according to two distinct 1-dimensional irreducible representation under the \(D_{3d}\) site symmetry can be realized.
        We dub these doublets dipolar-octupolar(DO) doublets because the pseudo-spin operator formed by those doublets transform in a non-trivial way under symmetry operation. Such model has the potential to realize not only topological insulator but also quantum spin ices which are long ranged entangled quantum states in 3+1D at different limit.

        <img src="images/QSI_phase_diagram.png" width="500" height="230" alt="" /></div>
        <p>At the localized limit, we got a nearest-neighbor coupled XYZ exchange model on pyrochlore lattice. Because of the special transformation properties under site symmetry,
        the model is surprisingly simple. A large portion of the parameter space had no sign problem and can be studied with large scale quantum Monde Carlo. Besides, our model
        provides a "quasi-realistic" way to realize onsite \(Z_2\times Z_2\) symmetry for nearest-neighbor exchange model on pyrochlore lattice.
        The model could realize 3+1D symmetry enriched topological order with two distict topological order (dipolar quantum spin ice and octupolar quantum spin ice) protected by space
         group symmetry.</p>
        <p>The non-trivial properties under site symmetry combined with the pyrochlore space group leads to two new low energy effective models at itenerent limit and localized limit.
        At itenerent limit, the model develop a "Dirac point like" band touching at W point till fourth nearest-neighbor hopping. By considering \(\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}\) theory and construct the
        fourth nearest-neighbor hopping model, we prove the W point degneracy is not protected by space group. Once generic fourth nearest-neighbor hopping is included, the 
        W point degeneracy will be removed. And leads to a strong topological insulator.

        <h2>Theory of quantum Kagome ice and vison zero modes</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Recently, significant advances in the theoretical understanding
	of the topological structure and the space group symmetry shed new
	lights on the possibility to detect global topological structure
	using symmetry defects. Several theoretical models demonstrate such
	behavior. However,  very little attention has been paid to their
	physical consequences, and they have not been discussed in a
	simple, physically relevant model.  In our work, we point out such
	idea provides striking numerical signals that can be measured using
	large scale unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulation. We find the
	topological excitation transforms non-trivially under particular
	space group symmetry and global symmetry which leads to non-trivial
	local degeneracy, vison zero mode, that indicates the topological
	structure of the quantum states.

        <p>Spin-orbit interaction in \(Sr_2IrO_4\) leads to the realization of the \(J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 1/2\) state and also induces an insulating behavior.
        Local experiment group found two high-energy excitations of the d-shell multiplet at 690 meV and 680 meV

        We give a simple theoretical model based on symmetry analysis explained the observed selection rules and suggest the corresponding possible microscopic mechanism.
        We show that both pseudospin-flip and non-pseudosin-flip dd electronic transitions are Raman active, but only the latter are observed.

        <h2>Building crystalline topological phases from lower-dimensional states</h2>
        </div>
        <p>Topological phases protected by the geometrical symmetries of crystal lattices turn out to be surprisingly simple. They can be built from simpler lower-dimensional states, arranged in a crystalline pattern. </p>
            
        <p>We study the classification of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with crystalline symmetry (cSPT phases). Focusing on bosonic cSPT phases in two and three dimensions, we introduce a simple family of cSPT states, where the system is comprised of decoupled lower-dimensional building blocks that are themselves SPT states. We introduce a procedure to classify these block states, which surprisingly reproduces a classification of cSPT phases recently obtained by Thorngren and Else (arXiv:1612.00846) using very different methods, for all wallpaper and space groups. The explicit constructions underlying our results clarify the physical properties of the phases classified by Thorngren and Else, and expose additional structure in the classification. Moreover, the states we classify can be completely characterized by point-group SPT (pgSPT) invariants and related weak pgSPT invariants that we introduce. In many cases, the weak invariants can be visualized in terms of translation-symmetric stacking of lower-dimensional pgSPT states. We apply our classification to propose a Lieb-Shultz-Mattis–type constraint for two-dimensional spin systems with only crystalline symmetry, and establish this constraint by a dimensional reduction argument. Finally, the surprising matching with the Thorngren-Else classification leads us to conjecture that all SPT phases protected only by crystalline symmetry can be built from lower-dimensional blocks of invertible topological states. We argue that this conjecture holds if we make a certain physically reasonable but unproven assumption.
