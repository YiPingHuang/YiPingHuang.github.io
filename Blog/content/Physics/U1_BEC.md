Summary: The various definition of BEC had confused me for a while. I found the Chapter 2 of _quantum liquids_ by A. J. Leggett resolve lots of my misunderstandings. The gist is: the definition of BEC should _connect to real experiments_ , _be able to extend to multicomponent case_ and _creates no pseudo problems_.

From statistical course, we learned the most basic version of BEC, the
case for non-interacting bosons. After more reading, we learn the
theory of spontaneous symmetry breaking in magnetic system. For me, the problem
that always occupied my mind is what is the corresponding "magnetic field" which
break the $O(3)$ rotation symmetry for ideal Heisenberg ferromagnet in BEC that
breaks the $U(1)$ particle number conservation?

The part that really confuse me is what exactly _spontaneously broken $U(1)$
gauge symmetry_ means? First, my understanding about gauge structure is it is
not a physical symmetry, it is the redundancy of description for our theory.
The definition of gauge transformation defines what descriptions are physically
equivalent. So in general, gauge symmetry can never be broken. Second, in the
experiments, we don't really have the ability to break particle number
conservation. We can never kill/create an atom in the trap. The notion of
particle number conservation is broken always sounds dubious for me.

After, reading proffessor Leggett's book. My pain is eased a little bit. I think
the reason I am so confused for so long is a problem of _what is the proper
definition of BEC?_ It seems it is a problem that takes lots of physicists to
think about. Proffessor Leggett's attitude about the definition of BEC is

* The definition should connect to experimental reality. The finite size of experimental system, particles cannot be create from nowhere or die for no reason.
* The definition should be able to generalize to multicomponent BECs.
* Create no pseudo problems.

Professor Leggett prefer the definition by _single-particle density matrix_,
$\rho(r,r':t)$. $\rho(r,r':t)$ is Hermitian and thus can be diagonalized. If
only one eigenvalue domintates, then we got a simple BEC.

Unfortunately, I am confused because my old understanding rely on the definition
of BEC that would automatically generates some pseudo problems. Defining the
order parameter as $\langle\phi \rangle$ is really confusing in that sense.
