Summary: A book that worth reading to know more about algorithm.

The classical books,
[TAOCP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming), written
by professor Knuth. As a graduate student in physics, I don't have solid
background on computer science. However, after reading the first volume, I am
astonishing about this classic four volumes set. The book is written in a fashion
that it elaborates the idea behind each algorithm in an elegant way such that
even for a non-computer-science major student like me can enjoy the journey of
knowing classical computer science. It is a pity that I did not know these books
as an undergraduate student.

The part that I enjoy most as I read the first volume is the introduction to the
idea of basic algorithm and the simple example to introduce the analysis of
algorithm. The point I learned is that the analysis of algorithm is basically a
problem of discrete math. In this simple example, professor Knuth shown how
statistical mathematics and generating function helps us to understand
a simple algorithm.

The book is written in a style that the statement is so precise and convey the
essential ideas so effective that understanding how the problem is solved is
really a pleasure.
