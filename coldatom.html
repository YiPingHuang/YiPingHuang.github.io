        <h1>Synthetic quantum matter</h1>
	</div>

	<p> The advance in atomic, molecular, and optical physics allows us to explore
	emergent quantum phases of matter in different physical regimes. Various
	platforms ranging from cold atoms, ions, superconductor qubits, circuit QED
	provides different paths to study quantum many-body phenomena. In addition to
	the studies of hard condensed matter problems such as quantum simulation of
	Hubbard model and localization, the field has been extended to study gauge
	theories which play a fundamental role in our understanding of high-energy
	physics and constrained quantum systems such as frustrated magnetism.
	</p>
	<p> In addition to the connections with various frontiers of studies, the
	synthetic quantum matter has advantages beyond conventional settings. For
	example,  it provides a suitable framework to study fundamental questions in
	the dynamics of quantum many-body systems and quantum information sciences.
	</p>

        <h2>Far from equilibrium dynamics of lattice gauge theories</h2>
	</div>
	<p> In the last several decades, studies of gapped quantum phases of matter
	have made significant advances on the classification of ground states and the
	characterization of low energy excitations. One of the key
	ingredients is the notion of many-body entanglement. The entanglement
	pattern gives us deep insights towards the understanding of many-body
	wave functions. It also becomes more and more evident that gauge theory
	plays an important role in describing the entanglement pattern.
	</p>
	<p>
	However, how to extend the notion to the non-equilibrium setting is
	still an open question. To characterize a quantum many-body system, one
	needs to specify the Hilbert space, \(\mathcal{H}\), and the
	Hamiltonian, \( H \). In the study of quantum phases, one usually
	focus on ground state manifold. The fact that ground state manifold
	provides massive information of the system is because the Hamiltonian
	encode the physics of other excited states into the ground states.
	Similarly, excited states also contain partial information of the ground
	states. However, the third law of thermodynamics forbidden direct
	realization/probe of the system. It is therefore interesting to ask is it
	possible to understand the many-body ground states from experimentally
	accessible excited states? 
	</p>
	<div style="text-align: center">
        <h3>Dynamical quantum phase transitions in \(U(1)\) quantum link models</h3>
	</div>
	<p> In equilibrium, phase transition happened when the free energy density
	develops non-analyticity at thermodynamic limit. For out of equilibrium quantum
	systems, the dynamics are governed by Schrodinger equation. The Loschmidt echo can be
	formally interpreted as partition function. The rate function of the Loschmidt echo
	thus plays a similar role to the free energy density. The dynamical quantum phase
	transition(DQPT) happens at the critical time when this quantity develops non-analyticity.
	The notion of phase transition is then generalized to a dynamical quantum system. The
	study of related phenomena is still at its infancy and most understanding is built
	from exact solvable models or low dimensional systems. It will be nice if we
	can find more examples that is beyond above mentioned situations.
	</p>

	<p> The idea of quantum simulation has bee developed and applied on condensed
	matter related system for decades. Recently, the concept has been pushed
	forward to simulate gauge theories. One of the obstacles in quantum simulator
	is the local Hilbert space is usually of finite dimensional. Quantum Link
	Model(QLM) thus plays a special role that it provides the gauge structure using
	finite dimensional Hilbert space. Besides, recent quantum simulation
	experiments demonstrate the possibility of engineering gauge invariant
	Hamiltonian and coherent many-body real time evolution.</p>

	<p> In this project, we explore the quench dynamics of gauge theories through the
	lens of dynamical quantum phase transitions. Using time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) and
	Lanczos-based exact diagonalization, we explore (1+1) d and (2+1) d QLMs. The
	advantage of using TEBD is it is almost exact in (1+1) d at short time. For
	(2+1) d, naive full spectrum ED will hit the wall of enumerating of states and
	it can only reach 4 by 4 (32 spin) system in a reasonable time. Using
	Lanczos-based method has two primary advantages. First, we perform exact
	time-evolution within the Krylov subspace where the information of the sparse
	many-body Hamiltonian is compacted in a dense effective matrix which is easy
	to solve. Second, the Krylov space is generated at run time which reduces the
	requirement of memory and allows us to go to larger system such as 4 by 6(48
	spins) and 6 by 6(72 spins). Also, the Krylov space will stay in the same
	gauge sector automatically as the Hamiltonian is gauge invariant.
	This property helps us bypass the enumeration of gauge invariant states in a neat
	way. The problem thus becomes manageable.
	</p>

	<p> Using the code I developed, we found DQPT in both (1+1) d and (2+1) d U(1)
	QLMs. We also found the corresponding order parameters and describe their
	physical meaning. This work can be found <a hre="https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07874">here</a>.

        <h2>Ultracold dipolar fermions</h2>
	</div>
        <p>Dipolar gasses are unstable under head-to-tail configuration. To stabilize dipolar gasses, different geometric arrangements are proposed. Trapping dipolar gasses in 1D tubes is one possibility.
        </p>
        <p> In this work, we generalize previous Luttinger liquid approach of two
	tubes into an arbitrary number of tubes lying in the same plane with arbitrary
	dipole orientation. Furthermore, we are able to map out the complete phase
	diagram for a different number of tubes under different dipole orientation.
	This work potentially can be realized in near future. This work is published
